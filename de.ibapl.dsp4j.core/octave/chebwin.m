## Usage:  chebwin (n, at)

## Returns the filter coefficients of the n-point Dolph-Chebyshev window
## with at dB of attenuation in the stop-band of the corresponding
## Fourier transform.

##   optimizes the relationship between beam width and side-lobe level",
##   Proc. IEEE, 34, pp. 335-348.
##
## The window is described in frequency domain by the expression:
##
##          Cheb(n-1, beta * cos(pi * k/n))
##   W(k) = -------------------------------
##                 Cheb(n-1, beta)
##
## with
##
##   beta = cosh(1/(n-1) * acosh(10^(at/20))
##
## and Cheb(m,x) denoting the m-th order Chebyshev polynomial calculated
## at the point x.
##
## Note that the denominator in W(k) above is not computed, and after
## the inverse Fourier transform the window is scaled by making its
## maximum value unitary.
