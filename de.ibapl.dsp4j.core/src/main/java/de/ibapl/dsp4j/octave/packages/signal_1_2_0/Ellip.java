## N-ellip 0.2.1
##usage: [Zz, Zp, Zg] = ellip(n, Rp, Rs, Wp, stype,'s')
##
## Generate an Elliptic or Cauer filter (discrete and contnuious).
## 
## [b,a] = ellip(n, Rp, Rs, Wp)
##  low pass filter with order n, cutoff pi*Wp radians, Rp decibels 
##  of ripple in the passband and a stopband Rs decibels down.
##
## [b,a] = ellip(n, Rp, Rs, Wp, 'high')
##  high pass filter with cutoff pi*Wp...
##
## [b,a] = ellip(n, Rp, Rs, [Wl, Wh])
##  band pass filter with band pass edges pi*Wl and pi*Wh ...
##
## [b,a] = ellip(n, Rp, Rs, [Wl, Wh], 'stop')
##  band reject filter with edges pi*Wl and pi*Wh, ...
##
## [z,p,g] = ellip(...)
##  return filter as zero-pole-gain.
##
## [...] = ellip(...,'s')
##     return a Laplace space filter, W can be larger than 1.
## 
## [a,b,c,d] = ellip(...)
##  return  state-space matrices
