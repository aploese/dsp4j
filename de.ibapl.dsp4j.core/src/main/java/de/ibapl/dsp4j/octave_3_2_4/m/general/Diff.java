## @deftypefn {Function File} {} diff (@var{x}, @var{k}, @var{dim})
## If @var{x} is a vector of length @var{n}, @code{diff (@var{x})} is the
## vector of first differences
## @tex
##  $x_2 - x_1, \ldots{}, x_n - x_{n-1}$.
## @end tex
## @ifnottex
##  @var{x}(2) - @var{x}(1), @dots{}, @var{x}(n) - @var{x}(n-1).
## @end ifnottex
##
## If @var{x} is a matrix, @code{diff (@var{x})} is the matrix of column
## differences along the first non-singleton dimension.
##
## The second argument is optional.  If supplied, @code{diff (@var{x},
## @var{k})}, where @var{k} is a non-negative integer, returns the
## @var{k}-th differences.  It is possible that @var{k} is larger than
## then first non-singleton dimension of the matrix.  In this case,
## @code{diff} continues to take the differences along the next
## non-singleton dimension.
##
## The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly
## stated with the optional variable @var{dim}.  In this case the 
## @var{k}-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.
## In the case where @var{k} exceeds @code{size (@var{x}, @var{dim})}
## then an empty matrix is returned.
