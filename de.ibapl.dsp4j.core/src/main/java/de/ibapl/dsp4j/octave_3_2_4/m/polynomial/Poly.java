## @deftypefn {Function File} {} poly (@var{a})
## If @var{a} is a square @math{N}-by-@math{N} matrix, @code{poly (@var{a})}
## is the row vector of the coefficients of @code{det (z * eye (N) - a)},
## the characteristic polynomial of @var{a}.  As an example we can use
## this to find the eigenvalues of @var{a} as the roots of @code{poly (@var{a})}.
## @example
## @group
## roots(poly(eye(3)))
## @result{} 1.00000 + 0.00000i
## @result{} 1.00000 - 0.00000i
## @result{} 1.00000 + 0.00000i
## @end group
## @end example
## In real-life examples you should, however, use the @code{eig} function
## for computing eigenvalues.
##
## If @var{x} is a vector, @code{poly (@var{x})} is a vector of coefficients
## of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of @var{x}.  That is,
## of @var{c} is a polynomial, then the elements of
## @code{@var{d} = roots (poly (@var{c}))} are contained in @var{c}.
## The vectors @var{c} and @var{d} are, however, not equal due to sorting
## and numerical errors.
## @seealso{eig, roots}
